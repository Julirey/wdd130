    <h2>Julio Reyes</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Julio Reyes, I'm from Venezuela. I was able to apply to BYU-Idaho through the Pathway program with the objective
        of achieving a Bachelor's degree in Software Development, as I always had a great interest in the inner workings of computers and the way it
        interacts with the software to succeed in creating the world we know today. </p>
    <p>As for my other interests, I like to read, I like to practice sports with my main ones being ping pong and volleyball, I like to play music and I have quite a 
        few instruments although the only one I actually spent time on is the piano, I like to draw but I only do it occasionally and there's still a 
        long way for me before I can consider myself "decent" at it, and I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy videogames too. </p>
    <p>It's my pleasure to be here and learn together about this fundamental aspect of the internet and web development and I hope we get along well.</p>
